# Build / Update Screens and Views from Design System

Use this skill to create or update **screens, views, and multi-section UI containers** in Figma by **reusing the published design system** — components, variables, and styles — rather than drawing primitives with hardcoded values. This includes full pages, modals, dialogs, drawers, sidebars, panels, and any composed view with multiple sections. The key insight: the Figma file likely has a published design system with components, color/spacing variables, and text/effect styles that correspond to the codebase's UI components and tokens. Find and use those instead of drawing boxes with hex colors.

**MANDATORY**: You MUST also load [figma-use](../figma-use/SKILL.md) before any `use_figma` call. That skill contains critical rules (color ranges, font loading, etc.) that apply to every script you write.

**Always include `figma-generate-design` in the comma-separated `skillNames` parameter when calling `use_figma` as part of this skill. If this skill was loaded via an MCP resource, you MUST prefix the name with `resource:` (e.g. `resource:figma-generate-design`).** This is a logging parameter — it does not affect execution.

## Skill Boundaries

- Use this skill when the deliverable is a **composed Figma view** (new or updated) — full-page screens, modals, dialogs, drawers, sidebars, panels, or any multi-section container — built from design system component instances.
- If the user wants to create **new reusable components or variants**, use [figma-use](../figma-use/SKILL.md) directly.
- If the user wants to write **Code Connect mappings**, switch to [figma-code-connect](../figma-code-connect/SKILL.md).

## Prerequisites

- Figma MCP server must be connected
- The target Figma file must have a published design system with components (or access to a team library)
- User must provide a target Figma file (URL or `fileKey`). If they don't have one yet, invoke `/figma-create-new-file` (or call `create_new_file`) first and reuse the returned file_key. Both `use_figma` and `generate_figma_design` require an existing `fileKey`.
- Source code or description of the screen/view to build/update

## Parallel Workflow with generate_figma_design (Web Apps Only)

When building a screen from a **web app** that can be rendered in a browser, the best results come from running both approaches in parallel:

1. **In parallel:**
   - Start building the screen using this skill's workflow (use_figma + design system components) against the target Figma file (`fileKey`).
   - Run `generate_figma_design` against the **same `fileKey`** to capture a pixel-perfect screenshot of the running web app into that file. `generate_figma_design` always requires `fileKey` — if the user does not yet have a Figma file, first invoke `/figma-create-new-file` (or call the `create_new_file` MCP tool) to get one, and reuse that file_key for both this skill and the capture.
2. **Once both complete:** Update the use_figma output to match the pixel-perfect layout from the `generate_figma_design` capture. The capture provides the exact spacing, sizing, and visual treatment to aim for, while your use_figma output has proper component instances linked to the design system. If the capture contains images, transfer them to your use_figma output by copying `imageHash` values from the capture's image fills (see Step 5 for details).
3. **Once confirmed looking good:** Delete the `generate_figma_design` output — it was only used as a visual reference.

This combines the best of both: `generate_figma_design` gives pixel-perfect layout accuracy, while use_figma gives proper design system component instances that stay linked and updatable.

**This parallel workflow is MANDATORY when the source contains images.** The `use_figma` Plugin API cannot fetch external image URLs — it can only set image fills by copying `imageHash` values from nodes already in the file. `generate_figma_design` rasterizes all visible images into Figma, providing the hashes you need. If you skip the capture when images are present, image frames will be left blank.

For non-web apps (iOS, Android, etc.) or when updating existing screens, use the standard workflow below.

## Required Workflow

**Follow these steps in order. Do not skip steps.**

> **Hard gates — forbidden shortcuts:**
>
> - **Forbidden:** `search_design_system` for component keys until 2a-i is complete and 2a-ii is attempted or logged N/A (e.g. "empty file, no existing screens").
> - **Forbidden:** Any `use_figma` call that mutates the canvas (Step 3+) until all Step 2 rows in the checklist below are filled in.

### Step 1: Understand the Deliverable

Before touching Figma, understand what you're building:

1. If building from code, read the relevant source files to understand the structure, sections, and which components are used.
2. Identify the major sections of the view (e.g., for a page: Header, Hero, Content Panels, Footer; for a modal: Title Bar, Form Sections, Action Bar; for a sidebar: Navigation, Content Area, Footer Actions).
3. For each section, list the UI components involved (buttons, inputs, cards, navigation pills, accordions, etc.).
4. **Identify the product's font family from the source. Do not default to Inter.** Find *which* typeface the product uses before writing any script. See [references/discover-product-font.md](references/discover-product-font.md) for where to look (CSS variables, component files) and how to resolve messy Figma font names.
5. **Check whether the view contains any images** (e.g., `<img>`, `<Image>`, background images, product photos, avatars, icons loaded from URLs). If it does and this is a web app, you **must** run the parallel `generate_figma_design` capture workflow — start it immediately alongside Step 2 so the capture runs while you discover components. See "Parallel Workflow with generate_figma_design" above.

### Step 2: Collect Component Keys, Variables, and Styles

You need three things from the design system: **components** (buttons, cards, etc.), **variables** (colors, spacing, radii), and **styles** (text styles, effect styles like shadows). Don't hardcode hex colors or pixel values when design system tokens exist.

#### 2a: Discover components

**2a-i — REQUIRED: Check Code Connect for needed components.** Starting from the component list you built in Step 1, check whether each component has a Code Connect file in the codebase. Code Connect files live next to the component source and are named by platform:

- **TypeScript/JS**: `*.figma.ts`, `*.figma.js`
- **React (parser-based)**: `*.figma.tsx`
- **Kotlin/Compose**: `.kt` files containing `@FigmaConnect`
- **Swift**: `.swift` files containing `FigmaConnect`

For each component you need (e.g., Button, Card, Input), search for its Code Connect file — glob or grep by component name (e.g., `**/Button.figma.tsx`, `**/Card.figma.ts`). Only read files that match components you actually need.

From each matching Code Connect file, extract the Figma component URL. Parse `fileKey` and `nodeId` from the URL (convert hyphens to colons: `123-456` → `123:456`). Then resolve component keys via `use_figma`:

**Example:** Code Connect file contains `// url=https://figma.com/design/ABC123/File?node-id=609-35535`. Parse `fileKey` = `ABC123`, `nodeId` = `609:35535`. Run `use_figma` against the **library file** (fileKey `ABC123`, not the target file) to resolve the key:

```js
const node = await figma.getNodeByIdAsync("609:35535");
const set = node?.parent?.type === "COMPONENT_SET" ? node.parent : node;
return { componentKey: set.key };
```

Batch multiple lookups in a single call. Use the returned keys with `importComponentSetByKeyAsync()` in Step 4.

Mark resolved components. If all components are resolved, skip 2a-ii and 2a-iii. If none of the needed components have Code Connect files, proceed to 2a-ii.

**2a-ii — REQUIRED if unresolved components remain: Inspect existing screens.** Check if the target file already contains screens using the same design system. A single `use_figma` call that walks an existing frame's instances gives you an exact, authoritative component map:

```js
// Read-only discovery — skip invisible content inside instances (hidden
// variants etc.) for the hundreds-of-times-faster findAllWithCriteria.
figma.skipInvisibleInstanceChildren = true;

const frame = figma.currentPage.findOne(n => n.name === "Existing Screen");
const uniqueSets = new Map();
frame.findAllWithCriteria({ types: ["INSTANCE"] }).forEach(inst => {
  const mc = inst.mainComponent;
  const cs = mc?.parent?.type === "COMPONENT_SET" ? mc.parent : null;
  const key = cs ? cs.key : mc?.key;
  const name = cs ? cs.name : mc?.name;
  if (key && !uniqueSets.has(key)) {
    uniqueSets.set(key, { name, key, isSet: !!cs, sampleVariant: mc.name });
  }
});
return [...uniqueSets.values()];
```

Match results against your unresolved components. Mark any newly resolved. If all components are resolved, skip 2a-iii.

**2a-iii — LAST RESORT: `search_design_system`.** Only if components remain unresolved after completing both 2a-i and 2a-ii.

Before searching, call `get_libraries` to discover which libraries are available for the file. This returns two lists: libraries already added to the file and libraries available to add (community UI kits and org libraries). Each entry includes a `libraryKey` you can pass to `search_design_system` via the `includeLibraryKeys` param to scope your search to specific libraries instead of searching across everything.

```
// Step 1: Discover available libraries
get_libraries({ fileKey })
// Returns: {
//   libraries_added_to_file: [...],
//   libraries_available_to_add: [...],
//   libraries_available_to_add_next_offset: number | null
// }

// Step 2: Search within a specific library using its libraryKey
search_design_system({ query: "button", fileKey, includeLibraryKeys: ["lk-abc123..."] })
```

Org libraries in `libraries_available_to_add` are paginated (20 per page). When `libraries_available_to_add_next_offset` is non-null, more org libraries are available — call `get_libraries` again with `offset` set to that value to fetch the next page. Community UI kits only appear on the first page. If the user names a specific library you don't see in the current page, page further before giving up.

This is especially useful when the file has many libraries and you want targeted results (e.g. searching only within "iOS 26" or "Material 3" instead of getting matches from every library).

**Search broadly** — try multiple terms and synonyms (e.g., "button", "input", "nav", "card", "accordion", "header", "footer", "tag", "avatar", "toggle", "icon", etc.). Use `includeComponents: true` to focus on components.

**Include component properties** in your map — you need to know which TEXT properties each component exposes for text overrides. Create a temporary instance, read its `componentProperties` (and those of nested instances), then remove the temp instance.
