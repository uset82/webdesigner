description: "**MANDATORY prerequisite** — you MUST invoke this skill BEFORE every `use_figma` tool call. NEVER call `use_figma` directly without loading this skill first. Skipping it causes common, hard-to-debug failures. Trigger whenever the user wants to perform a write action or a unique read action that requires JavaScript execution in the Figma file context — e.g. create/edit/delete nodes, set up variables or tokens, build components and variants, modify auto-layout or fills, bind variables to properties, or inspect file structure programmatically."

# use_figma — Figma Plugin API Skill

Use the `use_figma` tool to execute JavaScript in Figma files via the Plugin API. All detailed reference docs live in `references/`.

**Always include `figma-use` in the comma-separated `skillNames` parameter when calling `use_figma`. If this skill was loaded via an MCP resource, you MUST prefix the name with `resource:` (e.g. `resource:figma-use`).** This is a logging parameter used to track skill usage — it does not affect execution.

**If Figma MCP tools appear as deferred tools, batch-load all their schemas in a single `ToolSearch` call** using the `select:` syntax — e.g. `ToolSearch query="select:use_figma,get_screenshot,get_metadata,create_new_file"`. One round trip beats six.

**If the task involves building or updating a full page, screen, or multi-section layout in Figma from code**, also load [figma-generate-design](../figma-generate-design/SKILL.md). It provides the workflow for discovering design system components via `search_design_system`, importing them, and assembling screens incrementally. Both skills work together: this one for the API rules, that one for the screen-building workflow.

**If the task involves creating or building a component in Figma** (even a single component), also load [figma-generate-library](../figma-generate-library/SKILL.md). It provides the component creation workflow — variable foundations, variant sets, design token bindings — that `figma-use` alone doesn't cover.

Before anything, load [plugin-api-standalone.index.md](references/plugin-api-standalone.index.md) to understand what is possible. When you are asked to write plugin API code, use this context to grep [plugin-api-standalone.d.ts](references/plugin-api-standalone.d.ts) for relevant types, methods, and properties. This is the definitive source of truth for the API surface. It is a large typings file, so do not load it all at once, grep for relevant sections as needed.

IMPORTANT: Whenever you work with design systems, start with [working-with-design-systems/wwds.md](references/working-with-design-systems/wwds.md) to understand the key concepts, processes, and guidelines for working with design systems in Figma. Then load the more specific references for components, variables, text styles, and effect styles as needed.

## 1. Critical Rules

1.  **Use `return` to send data back.** The return value is JSON-serialized automatically (objects, arrays, strings, numbers). Do NOT call `figma.closePlugin()` or wrap code in an async IIFE — this is handled for you.
2.  **Write plain JavaScript with top-level `await` and `return`.** Code is automatically wrapped in an async context. Do NOT wrap in `(async () => { ... })()`.
3.  `figma.notify()` **throws "not implemented"** — never use it
3a. `getPluginData()` / `setPluginData()` are **not supported** in `use_figma` — do not use them. Use `getSharedPluginData()` / `setSharedPluginData()` instead (these ARE supported), or track node IDs by returning them and passing them to subsequent calls.
4.  `console.log()` is NOT returned — use `return` for output
5.  **Work incrementally in small steps.** Break large operations into multiple `use_figma` calls. Validate after each step. This is the single most important practice for avoiding bugs.
6.  Colors are **0–1 range** (not 0–255): `{r: 1, g: 0, b: 0}` = red
7.  Fills/strokes are **read-only arrays** — clone, modify, reassign
8.  **Every text edit follows the canonical recipe: load font → `await` → mutate → return affected node IDs.** Skipping the load throws `Cannot write to node with unloaded font "<family> <style>"`. The rule covers more than `characters` — it applies to any operation on nodes with unloaded fonts (`appendChild`, `insertChild`, `setBoundVariable`, `setExplicitVariableModeForCollection`, `setValueForMode`, `findAll` callbacks touching text). When mutating existing text, load the node's *current* fonts via `getStyledTextSegments(['fontName'])`, not a hardcoded default. Inter is preloaded in most environments so other families surface this bug more often — the recipe is the same for every font. Use `await figma.listAvailableFontsAsync()` first if the style string is unverified. See [Canonical text-edit recipe](references/gotchas.md#canonical-text-edit-recipe-font-load--await--mutate--return-ids).
9.  **Pages load incrementally** — use `await figma.setCurrentPageAsync(page)` to switch pages and load their content. The sync setter `figma.currentPage = page` does **NOT** work and will throw (see Page Rules below)
10. `setBoundVariableForPaint` returns a **NEW** paint — must capture and reassign
11. `createVariable` accepts collection **object or ID string** (object preferred)
12. **`layoutSizingHorizontal/Vertical` is value-restricted by structural context — `FIXED` always works, `HUG` and `FILL` do not.** `'HUG'` is valid only on an auto-layout frame itself OR on a **TEXT** child of one. `'FILL'` is valid only on a child of an auto-layout frame that is also not absolute-positioned, not inside an immutable frame, and not a canvas-grid child. Practical consequence: append to an auto-layout parent FIRST, then set `HUG`/`FILL` — a newly-created or unparented node can't satisfy the rule yet. The property itself exists on every `SceneNode`; the error is value-rejection, not "no such property". See [Gotchas](references/gotchas.md#layoutsizinghorizontallayoutsizingvertical-value-rules-fixed-hug-fill).
12a. **Use auto-layout for containers that hold related children.** When children have a structural relationship — stacked, side-by-side, aligned, gapped, hugged — wrap them in `figma.createAutoLayout()`, not `figma.createFrame()` with absolute `x`/`y`. Absolute coordinates govern where a container sits on the canvas; auto-layout governs how its children relate inside it. Skipping the container leaves no protection against text reflow, content changes, or overlap.
12b. **`layoutSizing*` and `*AxisSizingMode` are different enums — don't cross them.** `layoutSizingHorizontal`/`layoutSizingVertical` (set on a **child**) take `'FIXED'|'HUG'|'FILL'`; `primaryAxisSizingMode`/`counterAxisSizingMode` (set on the **frame** itself) take `'FIXED'|'AUTO'`. So `layoutSizingVertical = 'AUTO'` is invalid (use `'HUG'`), and `counterAxisSizingMode = 'FILL'` throws `Expected 'FIXED' | 'AUTO', received 'FILL'` (use `'FIXED'`/`'AUTO'`). Two more errors from the same setter — `Error: in set_layoutSizingHorizontal: node must be an auto-layout frame or a child of an auto-layout frame` and `Error: in set_layoutSizingHorizontal: FILL can only be set on children of auto-layout frames` — mean the node isn't in an auto-layout context yet; **recommendation: make the parent auto-layout (`figma.createAutoLayout()`) and `appendChild` the node before setting** (see Rule 12). See [Gotchas](references/gotchas.md#layoutsizing-vs-axissizingmode-two-different-sizing-enums).
13. **Position new top-level nodes away from (0,0).** Nodes appended directly to the page default to (0,0). Scan `figma.currentPage.children` to find a clear position (e.g., to the right of the rightmost node). This only applies to page-level nodes — nodes nested inside other frames or auto-layout containers are positioned by their parent. See [Gotchas](references/gotchas.md).
14. **On `use_figma` error, STOP. Do NOT immediately retry.** Failed scripts are **atomic** — if a script errors, it is not executed at all and no changes are made to the file. Read the error message carefully, fix the script, then retry. See [Error Recovery](#6-error-recovery--self-correction).
15. **MUST `return` ALL created/mutated node IDs.** Whenever a script creates new nodes or mutates existing ones on the canvas, collect every affected node ID and return them in a structured object (e.g. `return { createdNodeIds: [...], mutatedNodeIds: [...] }`). This is essential for subsequent calls to reference, validate, or clean up those nodes.
16. **Always set `variable.scopes` explicitly when creating variables.** The default `ALL_SCOPES` pollutes every property picker — almost never what you want. Use specific scopes like `["FRAME_FILL", "SHAPE_FILL"]` for backgrounds, `["TEXT_FILL"]` for text colors, `["GAP"]` for spacing, etc. See [variable-patterns.md](references/variable-patterns.md) for the full list.
17. **`await` every Promise.** Never leave a Promise unawaited — unawaited async calls (e.g. `figma.loadFontAsync(...)` without `await`, or `figma.setCurrentPageAsync(page)` without `await`) will fire-and-forget, causing silent failures or race conditions. The script may return before the async operation completes, leading to missing data or half-applied changes.

## 2. Page Rules (Critical)

**Page context resets between `use_figma` calls** — `figma.currentPage` starts on the first page each time.

### Switching pages

Use `await figma.setCurrentPageAsync(page)` to switch pages and load their content. The sync setter `figma.currentPage = page` does **NOT work** — it throws `"Setting figma.currentPage is not supported"` in `use_figma`. Always use the async method.

```js
// Switch to a specific page (loads its content)
const targetPage = figma.root.children.find((p) => p.name === "My Page");
await figma.setCurrentPageAsync(targetPage);
// targetPage.children is now populated
```

### Call `setCurrentPageAsync` at most once per `use_figma` invocation — fan multi-page work out in parallel

**One script must switch pages at most once.** Never loop over `figma.root.children` and switch pages inside the loop.

If the work spans multiple pages, **split it into N `use_figma` calls (one per target page) and emit them in parallel** — a single assistant message containing N `use_figma` tool-use blocks. The harness runs them concurrently; each script sets `currentPage` exactly once.

> **Explicit instruction:** when fanning out, you MUST issue the N tool calls in **one message**. Do not send them across multiple turns. Do not await one before issuing the next. Sequential per-page calls are slower than the in-loop pattern this rule replaces and waste the entire benefit of splitting.

```js
// AVOID — switches pages N times in one script, reloads the file each time
for (const page of figma.root.children) {
  await figma.setCurrentPageAsync(page);
  // ... touch this page ...
}

// PREFER — read-only discovery call to get page IDs, then in the NEXT message
// emit N parallel use_figma tool calls (one per page), each setting currentPage once.
```

Default to parallel fan-out for any multi-page work — reads and writes alike. See [gotchas.md → Set current page once per `use_figma` call](references/gotchas.md#set-current-page-once-per-use_figma-call--split-multi-page-work-into-parallel-calls) for the full rationale.

### Across script runs

`figma.currentPage` resets to the **first page** at the start of each `use_figma` call. If your workflow spans multiple calls and targets a non-default page, call `await figma.setCurrentPageAsync(page)` at the start of each invocation.

You can call `use_figma` multiple times to incrementally build on the file state, or to retrieve information before writing another script. For example, write a script to get metadata about existing nodes, `return` that data, then use it in a subsequent script to modify those nodes.

## 3. `return` Is Your Output Channel

The agent sees **ONLY** the value you `return`. Everything else is invisible.

- **Returning IDs (CRITICAL)**: Every script that creates or mutates canvas nodes **MUST** return all affected node IDs — e.g. `return { createdNodeIds: [...], mutatedNodeIds: [...] }`. This is a hard requirement, not optional.
- **Progress reporting**: `return { createdNodeIds: [...], count: 5, errors: [] }`
- **Error info**: Thrown errors are automatically captured and returned — just let them propagate or `throw` explicitly.
- `console.log()` output is **never** returned to the agent
- Always return actionable data (IDs, counts, status) so subsequent calls can reference created objects
